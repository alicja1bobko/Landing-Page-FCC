        <h3>Colours</h3>
        <p>We like white the most, but white is not always enough ...
Standard ledon, i.e. white, white face, white luminous and white after switching off.
  Colorful ledon. The face in it is colorful, so the ledon shines in this one color and remains in it after switching off, you can choose from 8 variants shown below
Ledon multicolor (RGB). When turned off, the face is white, and when turned on, it glows in almost any color you choose with the remote.<p>

        <h3>Gadgets</h3>
        <p>The comfort of use is increased by, you know, gadgets installed on request, e.g. a remote control with a dimmer, thanks to which you can turn the inscription on and off and regulate the light intensity. We recommend this solution especially for small rooms, for a bedroom or office.

If you have RGB ledon, you can change not only the brightness, but most of all the color of the entire string!<p>

TECHNOLOGICAL MINIMUM: The thickness (width) of the "lines" cannot be less than 15 mm.
In practice, this means that we cannot make very small, thin letters or very small elements. Both inscriptions consisting of combined letters, constituting one element, as well as those in which the letters are separate and connected by a transparent "back" are possible.</p>
